# Find-Set-Match
This is a WiP android game that is done in my spare time.
It is a one or two-player puzzle game based on the Gyul!Hap! segment from the game show 'The Genius'.
To try it, simply download and open 'FindSetMatch.apk' on your phone.
Instructions to the game are included in the 'Help' page in the app.
